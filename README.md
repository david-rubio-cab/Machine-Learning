# Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting bank account fraud using a synthetic tabular dataset published at NeurIPS 2022. The dataset consists of multiple features related to customer transactions, account details, and device information. The primary objective is to predict fraudulent transactions, a highly imbalanced problem where only a small fraction of records are labeled as fraud.
